# Node KernelSU

I just got bored and wanna try this. Thanks to @HuskyDG to let notice that KernelSU has netive apis.

## Uhm

The following aren't supported because Node.js can't handle this or to much effort to integrate it.

```js
const { KernelSU } require('node-ksu')

KernelSU.setAppProfile(...)
KernelSU.getAppProfile(...)
```

## API

Please read this file [here](src/KernelSU.js)
